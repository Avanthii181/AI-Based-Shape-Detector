# Shape Detector

It built with Python's Tkinter library, which allows the user to draw on a canvas and automatically detects basic shapes (circles and squares) based on the drawing.

## Features:
- Draw freehand on the canvas.
- After drawing, the app attempts to recognize the shape (Circle or Square).
- Displays feedback on the recognized shape or informs the user that the shape is not recognized.
- Clear the canvas and start a new drawing.

## How It Works:
1. **Freehand Drawing**: The user can draw freely by holding down the left mouse button on the canvas.
2. **Shape Recognition**: After the user releases the mouse button, the app analyzes the drawing to detect a circle or square.
3. **Feedback**: Once the drawing is analyzed, the app displays a message saying whether a **Circle** or **Square** was detected, or if the shape is **not recognized**.
4. **Clear Drawing**: Users can clear the drawing and start fresh with the "Clear Drawing" button.
